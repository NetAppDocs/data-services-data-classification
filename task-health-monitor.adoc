The NetApp Data Classification Health Monitor dashboard provides real-time monitoring and insights into performance. The Health Monitor captures information about your Data Classification infrastructure, system health, usage metrics, and utilization data, enabling you to identify and remediate issues. 

== Health Monitor insights 

The Health Monitor dashboard presents information in four categories. 

* **Infrastructure status**
+
View information including the version status, system stability, deployment type, and machine scale.

* **Problematic containers**
+
Review the problematic containers field for insights into containers that are stopped or restarting frequently. Use this information to investigate the specific containers. 

* **System information**
+
The system information panel captures critical information about the NetApp Console and Data Classification such as the public and private IP addresses, host name, operating system, Console version, and Console ID. 

* **Usage and utilization**
