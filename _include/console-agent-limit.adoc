Data Classification does not impose a limit on the amount of data it can scan. Each Console agent supports scanning and displaying 500 TiB of data. To scan more than 500 TiB of data, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html#connector-installation[install another Console agent^] then link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-data-classification/task-deploy-overview.html[deploy another Data Classification instance]. +
The Console UI displays data from a single connector. For tips on viewing data from multiple Console agents, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-manage-multiple-connectors.html#switch-between-connectors[Work with multiple Console agents^].
