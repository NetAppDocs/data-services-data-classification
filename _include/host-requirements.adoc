* Data Classification is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications - the host must be a dedicated host.
//This include is used in 3 Linux deploy topics

* When building the host system in your premises, you can choose among these system sizes depending on the size of the dataset that you plan to have Data Classification scan.

* When deploying a compute instance in the cloud for your Data Classification installation, it's recommended you use a system that meets the "Large" system requirements above:

** *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance type*: "m6i.4xlarge". link:reference-instance-types.html#aws-instance-types[See additional AWS instance types^]. 
** *Azure VM size*: "Standard_D16s_v3". link:reference-instance-types.html#azure-instance-types[See additional Azure instance types^].
** *GCP machine type*: "n2-standard-16". link:reference-instance-types.html#gcp-instance-types[See additional GCP instance types^].

* *UNIX folder permissions*: The following minimum UNIX permissions are required:

| Folder
| Minimum Permissions

| /tmp | `rwxrwxrwt`

| /opt | `rwxr-xr-x`

| /var/lib/docker | `rwx------`

| /usr/lib/systemd/system  | `rwxr-xr-x`
|===

* *Operating system*: 

** The following operating systems require using the Docker container engine:

*** Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.8 and 7.9
//*** CentOS version 7.8 and 7.9
//*** Rocky Linux 9 (requires Data Classification version 1.24 or greater)
*** Ubuntu 22.04 (requires Data Classification version 1.23 or greater)
*** Ubuntu 24.04 (requires Data Classification version 1.23 or greater)

** The following operating systems require using the Podman container engine, and they require Data Classification version 1.30 or greater:

*** Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8.8, 8.10, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6.

** Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX2) must be enabled on the host system.

* *Red Hat Subscription Management*: The host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the system can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during installation.

* *Additional software*: You must install the following software on the host before you install Data Classification:

** Depending on the OS you are using, you'll need to install one of the container engines:
+
*** Docker Engine version 19.3.1 or greater. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^].
*** Podman version 4 or greater. To install Podman, enter (`sudo yum install podman netavark -y`).

//*** Podman version 4 or greater. To install Podman, update your system packages (`sudo yum update -y`), and then install Podman (`sudo yum install netavark -y`). PRior to 7/25/2024

//https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux[View installation instructions^].

//RHEL 8 and 9 can use "sudo yum install netavark -y" instead of "sudo yum install podman -y" 

** Python version 3.6 or greater. https://www.python.org/downloads/[View installation instructions^].

* *NTP considerations*: NetApp recommends configuring the Data Classification system to use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service. The time must be synchronized between the Data Classification system and the Console agent system.
