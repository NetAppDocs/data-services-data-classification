You can start or stop scans on any system at any time from the Configuration page. You can also switch scans from mapping-only scans to mapping and classification scans, and vice-versa. It's recommended that you scan all volumes. 

TIP: New volumes added to the system are automatically scanned only when you have selected the *Map* or *Map & Classify* setting in the heading area. When set to *Custom* or *Off* in the heading area, you'll need to activate mapping and/or full scanning on each new volume you add in the system.

The switch at the top of the page for *Scan when missing "write" permissions* is disabled by default. This means that if Data Classification doesn't have write attributes permissions in CIFS, or write permissions in NFS, that the system won't scan the files because Data Classification can't revert the "last access time" to the original timestamp. If you don't care if the last access time is reset, turn the switch ON and all files are scanned regardless of the permissions. link:reference-collected-metadata.html#last-access-time-timestamp[Learn more^].

.Steps 

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Configuration*.
. Choose a system then select *Configuration*. 
. To enable or disable scans for all volumes, select **Map**, **Map & Classify**, or **Off** in the heading above all volumes.

    To enable or disable scans for individual volumes, find the volumes in the list then select **Map**, **Map & Classify**, or **Off** next to the volume name. 

[NOTE]
New volumes added to the system are automatically scanned only when you have set the *Map* or *Map & Classify* setting in the heading area. When set to *Custom* or *Off* in the heading area, you'll need to activate mapping and/or full scanning on each new volume you add in the system.

.Result

When you enable scanning, Data Classification starts scanning the volumes you selected in the system. Results start to appear in the Compliance dashboard as soon as Data Classification starts the scan. The time that it takes to complete depends on the amount of data, ranging from minutes to hours.
