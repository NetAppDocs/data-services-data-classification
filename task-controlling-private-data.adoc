Gain control of your private data by viewing details about the personal data (PII) and sensitive personal data (SPII) in your organization. You can also gain visibility by reviewing the categories and file types that NetApp Data Classification found in your data.

[NOTE]
File-level compliance details are only available if you perform a full classificaiton scan. Mapping-only scans don't yield file-level details. 

By default, the Data Classification dashboard displays compliance data for all systems and databases. To see data for only some of the systems, select them.

You can filter the results from the Data Investigation page and download a report of the results as a CSV file. See link:task-investigate-data.html[Filtering data in the Data Investigation page] for details.

== View files that contain personal data

Data Classification automatically identifies specific words, strings, and patterns (Regex) inside the data. link:link:reference-private-data-categories.html[For example, credit card numbers, social security numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, and more.] Data Classification identifies this type of information in individual files, in files within directories (shares and folders), and in database tables.

You can also create custom search terms to identify personal data specific to your organization. For more information, see link:task-custom-classification.html[Create a custom classification].

For some types of personal data, Data Classification uses _proximity validation_ to validate its findings. The validation occurs by looking for one or more predefined keywords in proximity to the personal data that was found. For example, Data Classification identifies a U.S. social security number (SSN) as an SSN if it sees a proximity word next to it--for example, _SSN_ or _social security_. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[The table of personal data] shows when Data Classification uses proximity validation.

== View files that contain sensitive personal data

Data Classification automatically identifies special types of sensitive personal information, as defined by privacy regulations such as https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e2051-1-1[articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR^]. For example, information regarding a person's health, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[See the full list]. Data Classification identifies this type of information in individual files, in files within directories (shares and folders), and in database tables.

Data Classification uses AI, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and cognitive computing (CC) to understand the meaning of the content that it scans in order to extract entities and categorize it accordingly.

For example, one sensitive GDPR data category is ethnic origin. Because of its NLP abilities, Data Classification can distinguish the difference between a sentence that reads "George is Mexican" (indicating sensitive data as specified in article 9 of the GDPR), versus "George is eating Mexican food."

NOTE: Only English is supported when scanning for sensitive personal data. Support for more languages will be added later.

.Steps

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Compliance*.

. To investigate the details for all sensitive personal data, locate the **Sensitive personal results** card then select **Show all**.
