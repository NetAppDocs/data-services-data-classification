[.lead]
The Data Investigation dashboard displays file and directory-level insights into your data, enabling you to sort and filter results. The Data Investigation page presents insights into file and directory metadata and permissions as well as identifying duplicate files. With file-, directory-, and database-level insights, you can take actions to improve the compliance of your organization and save storage space. The Data Investigation page also supports moving, copying, and deleting files. 

[NOTE]
To gain insights from the Investigation page, you must perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Data investigation structure

The Data Investigation page sorts data into three tabs:

- **Unstructured data**: file data
- **Directories**: folders and file shares
- **Structured**: database

== Data filters

The Data Investigation page provides numerous filters to sort through your data so you can what you need. You can use multiple filters in concert.

To add a filter, select the **Add filter** button.

== View file metadata

In addition to showing you the system and volume where the file resides, the metadata shows much more information, including the file permissions, file owner, and whether there are duplicates of this file. This information is useful if you're planning to link:task-using-policies.html[create saved queries] because you can see all the information that you can use to filter your data.

The availability of information depends on the data source. For example, volume name and permissions are not shared for database files.

.Steps

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Investigation*.
. In the Data Investigation list on the right, select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_file_details.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]
. Optionally, you can create or add a tag to the file with the *Create tag* button. Select an existing tag from the dropdown menu or add a new tag with the *+ Add* button. Tags can be used to filter data.

== View user permissions for files and directories

To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file or to a directory and the types of permissions they have, select *View all Permissions*. This option is available only for data in CIFS shares.

If you security identifiers (SIDs) instead of user and group names, you should integrate your Active Directory into Data Classification. For more information, see link:task-active-directory.html[add Active Directory to Data Classification].

.Steps

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Investigation*.
. In the Data Investigation list on the right, select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata.
. To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file or to a directory and the types of permissions they have, in the Open Permissions field, select *View all Permissions*. 
+
NOTE: Data Classification shows up to 100 users in the list. 

. Select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] button for any group to see the list of users who are part of the group.
+
TIP: You can expand one level of the group to see the users who are part of the group.

. Select the name of a user or group to refresh the Investigation page so you can see all the files and directories that the user or group has access to.

== Check for duplicate files in your storage systems

You can check whether duplicate files are being stored in your storage systems. This is useful if you want to identify areas where you can save storage space. It's also good to ensure certain files that have specific permissions or sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.

Data Classification compares all files (excluding databases) for duplicates if they are: 

- 1 MB or lager
- Or contain personal or sensitive personal information 

Data Classification uses hashing technology to determine duplicate files. If any file has the same hash code as another file, the files are exact duplicates even if the file names are different.

.Steps

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Investigation*.

. In Filter pane, select "File Size" along with "Duplicates" ("Has duplicates") to see which files of a certain size range are duplicated in your environment.

. Optionally, download the list of duplicate files and send it to your storage administrator so they can decide which files, if any, can be deleted. 
. Optionally, you can delete, tag, or move the duplicate files. Select the files you want to perform an action on, then select the appropriate action. 

*View if a specific file is duplicated*

You can see if a single file has duplicates. 

.Steps

. From the Data Classification menu, select *Investigation*.

. In the Data Investigation list, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata. 
+
If duplicates exist for a file, this information appears next to the _Duplicates_ field.

. To view the list of duplicate files and where they are located, select *View Details*. 
. In the next page select *View Duplicates* to view the files in the Investigation page.
. Optionally, you can delete, tag, or move the duplicate files. Select the files you want to perform an action on, then select the appropriate action. 


[TIP]
You can use the "file hash" value provided in this page and enter it directly in the Investigation page to search for a specific duplicate file at any time - or you can use it in a saved query.

== Download your report

You can download your filtered results in a CSV or JSON format. 

There can be up to three report files downloaded if Data Classification is scanning files (unstructured data), directories (folders and file shares), and databases (structured data).

The files are split into files with a fixed number of rows or records:

* JSON: 100,000 records per report that takes about 5 minutes to generate
* CSV: 200,000 records per report that takes about 4 minutes to generate

[NOTE]
You can download a version of the CSV file to view in this browser. This version is limited to 10,000 records. 


=== What's included in the downloadable report

The *Unstructured Files Data Report* includes the following information about your files:

* File name
* Location type
* System name
* Storage repository (for example, a volume, bucket, shares)
* Repository type
* File path
* File type
* File size (in MB)
* Created time
* Last modified
* Last accessed
* File owner
** File owner data encompasses account name, SAM account name, and e-mail address when Active Directory is configured. 
* Category
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information
* Open permissions
* Scan Analysis Error
* Deletion detection date
+
The deletion detection date identifies the date that the file was deleted or moved. This enables you to identify when sensitive files have been moved. Deleted files don't contribute to the file number count that appears in the dashboard or on the Investigation page. The files only appear in the CSV reports.

The *Unstructured Directories Data Report* includes the following information about your folders and file shares:

* System type
* System name
* Directory name
* Storage repository (for example, a folder or file shares)
* Directory owner
* Created time
* Discovered time
* Last modified
* Last accessed
* Open permissions
* Directory type

The *Structured Data Report* includes the following information about your database tables:

* DB Table name
* Location type
* System name
* Storage repository (for example, a schema)
* Column count
* Row count
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information


.Steps to generate the report

. From the Data Investigation page, select the image:button_download.png[download button] button on the top, right of the page.
