.Scan status

BlueXP classification tracks the real time progress of the _initial_ mapping and classification scans on a volume. Separate progressive bars track the mapping and classification scans, presenting a percentage of total files scanned. You can also hover over a progress bar to view the number of files scanned and the total files. Tracking the status of your scans creates deeper insights into the scan progress, enabling you to better plan your scans and understand resource allocation. 

To view the status of your scans, navigate to **Configuration** in BlueXP classification then select the **Working Environment configuration**. Progress is displayed in line for each volume.
