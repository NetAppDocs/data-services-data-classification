// Data Classification can send email alerts to NetApp Console users in your account when certain critical policies return results so you can get notifications to protect your data. You can choose to send the email notifications on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. You can also choose to send email alerts to any other email address - up to 20 email addresses - not in your BlueXP account. 

// You can configure this setting when creating the policy or when editing any policy.

// Follow these steps to add email updates to an existing policy.

// .Steps

// . From the Policies List page, select *Edit* for the policy where you want to add (or change) the email setting.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_add_email_alert_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing policy.]

// . In the Edit Policy page:
// .. Check the "Email all the users in this account" box if you want notification emails sent to users in your BlueXP account, and choose the interval at which the email is sent (for example, *Every Day*).
// .. Check the "Send Email" box if you want notification emails sent to additional users, choose the interval at which the email is sent, and enter up to 20 email addresses.
// +

// . Select *Save Policy* and the interval at which the email is sent appears in the policy description.

// .Result

// An email is sent if any files meet the policy criteria. No personal information is sent in the notification emails. The email indicates that there are files that match the policy criteria, and it provides a link to the policy results.

// == Delete source files automatically using policies

// You can create a custom Policy to delete files that match the policy. For example, you may want to delete files that contain sensitive information and were discovered by Data Classification in the past 30 days.

// Only Account Admins can create a policy to automatically delete files.

// NOTE: All files that match the policy will be permanently deleted once a day.

// .Steps

// . From the Data Investigation page, define your search by selecting all the filters you want to use. See link:task-investigate-data.html[Filtering data in the Data Investigation page^] for details.

// . Once you have all the filter characteristics just the way you want them, select *Create Policy from this search*.

// . Name the policy and select other actions that can be performed by the policy:
// .. Enter a unique name and description.
// .. Check the box to "Automatically delete files that match this policy" and type *permanently delete* to confirm that you want files permanently deleted by this policy.
// .. Select *Create Policy*.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_delete_files_using_policies.png[A screenshot that shows how to configure the policy and save it.]

// .Result

// The new policy appears in the Policies tab. Files that match the policy are deleted once per day when the policy runs.

// You can view the list of files that have been deleted in the link:task-view-compliance-actions.html[Actions Status pane].

// == Assign AIP labels automatically with policies

// You can assign an AIP label to all the files that meet the criteria of the policy. You can specify the AIP label when creating the policy, or you can add the label when editing any policy.

// Labels are added or updated in files continuously as Data Classification scans your files.

// Depending on whether a label is already applied to a file, and the classification level of the label, the following actions are taken when changing a label:

// [cols=2*,options="header",cols="60,40"]
// |===

// | If the file...
// | Then...

// | Has no label | The label is added
// | Has an existing label of a lower level of classification | The higher level label is added
// | Has an existing label of a higher level of classification | The higher level label is retained
// | Is assigned a label both manually and by a policy | The higher level label is added
// | Is assigned two different labels by two policies | The higher level label is added

// |===

// Follow these steps to add an AIP label to an existing policy.

// .Steps

// . From the Policies List page, select *Edit* for the policy where you want to add (or change) the AIP label.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing Policy.]

// . In the Edit Policy page, check the box to enable automatic labels for files that match the Policy parameters, and select the label (for example, *General*).
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_2.png[A screenshot showing how to select the label to be assigned to files that match the Policy.]

// . Select *Save Policy* and the label appears in the policy description.

// NOTE: If a policy was configured with a label, but the label has since been removed from AIP, the label name is turned to OFF and the label is not assigned anymore.
