// == Reviewing OneDrive requirements

// Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Data Classification.

// * You must have the Admin login credentials for the OneDrive for Business account that provides read access to the user's files.
// * You'll need a line-separated list of the email addresses for all the users whose OneDrive folders you want to scan.

// == Deploying the Data Classification instance

// Deploy Data Classification if there isn't already an instance deployed.

// Data Classification can be link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

// Upgrades to Data Classification software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

// //Data Classification can also be link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deployed in an on-premises location that has no internet access^]. However, you'll need to provide internet access to a few select endpoints to scan your local OneDrive files. 

// == Adding the OneDrive account

// Add the OneDrive account where the user files reside.

// .Steps

// . From the Systems Configuration page, select *Add Data Source* > *Add OneDrive Account*.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_onedrive_button.png[A screenshot of the Scan Configuration page where you can select the Add OneDrive button.]

// . In the Add a OneDrive account dialog, select *Sign in to OneDrive*.

// . In the Microsoft page that appears, select the OneDrive account and enter the required Admin user and password, then select *Accept* to allow Data Classification to read data from this account.

// The OneDrive account is added to the list of systems.

// == Adding OneDrive users to compliance scans

// You can add individual OneDrive users, or all of your OneDrive users, so that their files will be scanned by Data Classification.

// .Steps

// . From the _Configuration_ page, select the *Configuration* button for the OneDrive account.
// +

// . If this is the first time adding users for this OneDrive account, select *Add your first OneDrive users*.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_onedrive_add_initial_users.png[A screenshot showing the Add your first OneDrive users button to add initial users to an account.]
// +
// If you are adding additional users from a OneDrive account, select *Add OneDrive users*.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_onedrive_add_more_users.png[A screenshot showing the Add OneDrive users button to add more users to an account.]

// . Add the email addresses for the users whose files you want to scan - one email address per line (up to 100 maximum per session) - and select *Add Users*.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_onedrive_add_email_addresses.png[A screenshot of the Add OneDrive users page where you can add users to be scanned.]
// +
// A confirmation dialog displays the number of users who were added.
// +
// If the dialog lists any users who could not be added, capture this information so that you can resolve the issue. In some cases you can re-add the user with a corrected email address.

// . Enable mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, on user files.
// +

// | Disable scanning on user files | Select *Off*

// |===

// .Result

// Data Classification starts scanning the files for the users you added, and the results are displayed in the Dashboard and in other locations.

// == Removing a OneDrive user from compliance scans
