// NetApp Data Classification provides many ways for you to manage and organize your private data. This makes it easier to see the data that is most important to you.

// include::_include/legacy-version-130.adoc[]

// * If you are subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^] to classify and protect your files, you can use Data Classification to manage AIP labels.

// * You can add Tags to files that you want to mark for organization or for some type of follow-up.
// * You can assign a Console user to a specific file, or to multiple files, so that person can be responsible for managing the file.
// * With the saved search functionality, you can create your own custom search queries so that you can easily see the results from selecting one button.
// * You can send email alerts to Console users, or any other email address, when certain critical Saved searches return results.

// NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

// == Should I use tags or labels?

// Below is a comparison of Data Classification tagging and Azure Information Protection labeling.

// [cols=2*,options="header",cols="50,50"]
// |===

// | Tags
// | Labels

// | File tags are an integrated part of Data Classification. | Requires that you have subscribed to Azure Information Protection (AIP).
// | The tag is only kept in the Data Classification database - it is not written to the file.
// It does not change the file, or the file accessed or modified times. | The label is part of the file and when the label changes, the file changes. This change also changes the file accessed and modified times.
// | You can have multiple tags on a single file. | You can have one label on a single file.
// | The tag can be used for internal Data Classification action, such as copy, move, delete, run a policy, etc. | Other systems that can read the file can see the label - which can be used for additional automation.
// | Only a single API call is used to see if a file has a tag.  |

// |===

// == Categorize your data using AIP labels

// You can manage AIP labels in the files that Data Classification is scanning if you have subscribed to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^]. AIP enables you to classify and protect documents and files by applying labels to content. Data Classification enables you to view the labels that are already assigned to files, add labels to files, and change labels when a label already exists.

// Data Classification supports AIP labels within the following file types: .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX.

// [NOTE]
// ====
// * You can't currently change labels in files larger than 30 MB. For OneDrive, SharePoint, and Google Drive accounts the maximum file size is 4 MB.
// * If a file has a label which doesn't exist anymore in AIP, Data Classification considers it as a file without a label.
// * If you've deployed Data Classification in a Government region, or in an on-prem location that has no internet access (also known as a dark site), then the AIP label functionality is unavailable.
// ====

// === Integrate AIP labels in your project or workspace

// Before you can manage AIP labels, you need to integrate the AIP label functionality into Data Classification by signing into your existing Azure account. Once enabled, you can manage AIP labels within files for all link:concept-classification.html[data sources^] in your BlueXP project or workspace.

// .Requirements

// * You must have an account and an Azure Information Protection license.
// * You must have the login credentials for the Azure account.
// * If you plan to change labels in files that reside in Amazon S3 buckets, ensure that the permission `s3:PutObject` is included in the IAM role. See link:task-scanning-s3.html#reviewing-s3-prerequisites[setting up the IAM role^].

// .Steps

// . From the Data Classification Configuration page, select *Integrate AIP Labels*.
// // +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot that shows selecting the button to integrate AIP labels functionality into Data Classification.]

// . In the Integrate AIP Labels dialog, select *Sign in to Azure*.

// . In the Microsoft page that appears, select the account and enter the required credentials.

// . Return to the Data Classification tab and you'll see the message "_AIP Labels were integrated successfully with the account <account_name>_".

// . Select *Close* and you'll see the text _AIP Labels integrated_ at the top of the page.
// // +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_aip_labels_int.png[A screenshot that shows AIP labels have been successfully integrated.]

// .Result

// You can view and assign AIP labels from the results pane of the Investigation page. You can also assign AIP labels to files using Policies.

// === View AIP labels in your files

// You can view the current AIP label that is assigned to a file.

// In the Data Investigation results pane, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

// // image:screenshot_compliance_show_label.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a single file; including the assigned AIP label.]

// === Assign AIP labels manually

// You can add, change, and remove AIP labels from your files using Data Classification.

// Follow these steps to assign an AIP label to a single file.

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_manually.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

// . Select *Assign a Label to this file* and then select the label.
// +
// The label appears in the file metadata.

// Follow these steps to assign an AIP label to multiple files. Note that you can assign an AIP label to a maximum of 20 files at a time (one page in the UI).

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to label.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to label, and the Label button, from the Data Investigation page."]

// +
// * To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[""]).
// * To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]).
// // * To select all files on all pages, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]), and then in the pop-up message image:screenshot_select_all_items.png[], select *Select all items in list (xxx items)*.

// . From the button bar, select *Label* and select the AIP label:
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_select_aip_label_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign an AIP label to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]
// +
// The AIP label is added to the metadata for all selected files.

// === Remove the AIP integration

// If you no longer want the ability to manage AIP labels in files, you can remove the AIP account from the Data Classification interface.

// Note that no changes are made to the labels you have added using Data Classification. The labels that exist in files will stay as they currently exist.

// .Steps

// . From the _Configuration_ page, select *AIP Labels integrated > Remove Integration*.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_un_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot showing how to remove AIP integrations with Data Classification.]

// . Select *Remove Integration* from the confirmation dialog.

// == Apply tags to manage your scanned files

// You can add a tag to files that you want to mark for some type of follow-up. For example, you may have found some duplicate files and you want to delete one of them, but you need to check to see which one should be deleted. You could add a tag of "Check to delete" to the file so you know this file requires some research and some type of future action.

// Data Classification enables you to view the tags that are assigned to files, add or remove tags from files, and change the name or delete an existing tag.

// Note that the tag is not added to the file in the same way as AIP Labels are part of the file metadata. The tag is only visible to Console users using Data Classification; you can see if a file needs to be deleted or checked for some type of follow-up.
// just
// TIP: Tags assigned to files in Data Classification are not related to the tags you can add to resources, such as volumes or virtual machine instances. Data Classification tags are applied at the file level.

// === View files that have certain tags applied

// You can view all the files that have specific tags assigned.

// . Select the *Investigation* tab from Data Classification.

// . In the Data Investigation page, select *Tags* in the Filters pane and then select the required tags.
// +
// image:screenshot_compliance_filter_status.png[A screenshot showing how to select tags from the Filters pane.]
// +
// The Investigation Results pane displays all the files that have those tags assigned.

// === Assign tags to files

// You can add tags to a single file or to a group of files.

// To add a tag to a single file:

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

// . Select the *Tags* field and the currently assigned tags are displayed.

// . Add the tag or tags:
// * To assign an existing tag, select in the *New Tag...* field and start typing the name of the tag. When the tag you are looking for appears, select it and press *Enter*.
// * To create a new tag and assign it to the file, select in the *New Tag...* field, enter the name of the new tag, and press *Enter*.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_status_manually.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a tag to a file in the Data Investigation page.]
// +
// The tag appears in the file metadata.

// To add a tag to multiple files:

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to tag.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to tag, and the Tags button, from the Data Investigation page."]

// +
// * To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[""]).
// * To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]).
// * To select all files on all pages, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]), and then in the pop-up message image:screenshot_select_all_items.png[""], select *Select all items in list (xxx items)*.
// +
// You can apply tags to a maximum of 100,000 files at a time.

// . From the button bar, select *Tags* and the currently assigned tags are displayed.

// image:screenshot_compliance_select_tags_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a tag to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]

// . Approve adding the tags in the confirmation dialog and the tags are added to the metadata for all selected files.

// === Delete tags from files

// You can delete a tag if you don't need to use it anymore.

// Just select the *x* for an existing tag.

// // image:button_delete_datasense_file_tag.png[A screenshot of the delete tag button location.]

// If you had selected multiple files, the tag is removed from all the files.

// == Assign users to manage certain files

// You can assign a Console user to a specific file, or to multiple files, so that person can be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. This capability is often used with the feature to add custom Status tags to a file.

// For example, you might have a file that contains certain personal data that allows too many users read and write access (open permissions). So you could assign the Status tag "Change permissions" and assign this file to user "Joan Smith" so they can decide how to fix the issue. When they have fixed the issue they could change the Status tag to "Completed".

// The user name is not added to the file as part of the file metadata. It's only seen by Console users when using Data Classification.

// A new Filter in the Investigation page enables you to easily view all files that have the same person in the "Assigned To" field.

// Follow these steps to assign a user to a single file.

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

// . Select the *Assigned to* field and select the user name.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_user_manually.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a user to a file in the Data Investigation page.]
// +
// The User name appears in the file metadata.

// Follow these steps to assign a user to multiple files. Note that you can assign a user to a maximum of 20 files at a time (one page in the UI).

// .Steps

// . In the Data Investigation results pane, select the file, or files, that you want to assign to a user.
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_tag_multi_files.png["A screenshot showing how to select the files you want to assign to a user, and the Assign To button, from the Data Investigation page."]

// +
// * To select individual files, check the box for each file (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[""]).
// * To select all files on the current page, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]).
// // * To select all files on all pages, check the box in the title row (image:button_select_all_files.png[""]), and then in the pop-up message image:screenshot_select_all_items.png[], select *Select all items in list (xxx items)*.

// . From the button bar, select *Assign to* and select the user name:
// +
// // image:screenshot_compliance_select_user_multi.png[A screenshot showing how to assign a user to multiple files in the Data Investigation page.]
