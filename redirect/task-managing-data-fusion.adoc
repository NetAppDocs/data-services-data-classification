// NetApp Data Classification provides multiple ways for you to add a custom list of "personal data" that Data Classification will identify in scans, giving you the full picture about where potentially sensitive data resides in _all_ your organizations' files.

// [IMPORTANT]
// To create a custom classification in version 1.43 and later, see xref:task-custom-classification.adoc[Create a custom classification].

// include::_include/legacy-version-130.adoc[]

// * You can add unique identifiers based on specific columns in databases you are scanning.
// * You can add custom keywords from a text file -- these words are identified within your data.
// * You can add a personal pattern using a regular expression (regex) -- the regex is added to the existing predefined patterns.
// * You can add custom categories to identify where specific categories of information are found in your data.

// All of these mechanisms to add custom scanning criteria are supported in all languages.

// NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

// == Add custom personal data identifiers from your databases

// _Data Fusion_ allows you to scan your organization's data to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in any of your other data sources. You can choose the additional identifiers that Data Classification will look for in its scans by selecting a specific column or columns in a database table. For example, the diagram below shows how data fusion is used to scan your volumes, buckets, and databases for occurrences of all your Customer IDs from your Oracle database.

// //image:diagram_compliance_data_fusion.png[A diagram showing how content from your databases can be used as a source to identify files that contain the same data.]

// As you can see, two unique Customer IDs have been found in two volumes and in one S3 bucket. Any matches in database tables will also be identified.

// Note that since you're scanning your own databases, whatever language your data is stored in will be used to identify data in future Data Classification scans.

// .Steps

// You must have link:task-scanning-databases.html#add-the-database-server[added at least one database server^] to Data Classification before you can add data fusion sources.

// //. From the _Classification settings_ tab, select *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.
// //+
// //image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]
// //
// //. In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Personal identifier*, and then select *Next*.
// //+
// //The name you enter will appear in the Data Classification UI as the heading for scanned files that match the classifier requirements, and as the name of the filter in the Investigation page. 
// //+
// //You can also check the box to "Mask detected results in the system" so the full result won't appear in the UI. For example, you may want to do this to hide full credit card numbers or similar personal data (the mask would appear in the UI like this: "pass:[****] pass:[****] pass:[****]" 3434).
// //+
// //image:screenshot_select_classifier_type3.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]
// //
// //. In the _Select Data Analysis Tool_ page, select *DB fusion* as the method you want to use to define the classifier, and then select *Next*.
// //+
// //image:screenshot_select_classifier_tool_dbfusion.png[A screenshot showing the selection of DB fusion as the tool that Data Classification will use to build the pattern.]
// //
// //. In the _Create Logic_ page, enter the information that defines the database columns you want to use, and select *Done*.
// //.. Select the database where the source data resides.
// //.. Select the Database Schema from the drop-down menu.
// //.. Select the Table name in that schema.
// //.. Enter the Column, or Columns, that contain the unique identifiers you want to use.
// //+
// //When adding multiple columns, enter each column name, or table view name, on a separate line.
// //+
// //image:screenshot_select_classifier_create_logic_dbfusion.png["A screenshot of identifying the database, schema, table, and column for the data fusion source."]
// //+
// //The Custom Classifiers page displays the Data Fusion integration that you have configured Data Classification to scan in the Personal Information area.

// //+
// //The Data Fusion inventory page displays the database source columns that you have configured Data Classification to scan.
// //+
// //image:screenshot_compliance_data_fusion_list.png[A screenshot of all the data source references you have configured with Data Fusion.]

// . In the Configuration page, select *Manage Data Fusion* in the database where the source data resides.

// //image:screenshot_compliance_manage_data_fusion.png[A screenshot of selecting the Manage Data Fusion button to add a source column.]

// . Select *Add Data Fusion source* on the next page.

// . In the _Add Data Fusion Source_ page:
// .. Select the Database Schema from the drop-down menu.
// .. Enter the Table name in that schema.
// .. Enter the Column, or Columns, that contain the unique identifiers you want to use.
// +
// When adding multiple columns, enter each column name, or table view name, on a separate line.

// //image:screenshot_compliance_add_data_fusion.png[A screenshot of identifying the schema, table, and column for the data fusion source.]

// . Select *Add Data Fusion Source*.

// //image:screenshot_compliance_data_fusion_list.png[A screenshot of all the data source references you have configured with Data Fusion.]

// .Results
// After the next scan, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter. The name you used for the classifier appears in the filter list, for example `Customers.CustomerID`.

// //image:screenshot_add_data_fusion_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of Data Fusion results in the Investigation Results pane.]

// === Delete a Data Fusion source

// If at some point you decide not to scan your files using a certain Data Fusion source, you can select the source row from the Data Fusion inventory page and select *Delete Data Fusion Source*.

// //image:screenshot_compliance_delete_data_fusion.png[A screenshot showing how to remove a data fusion source.]

// == Add custom keywords from a list of words

// You can add custom keywords to Data Classification so that it will identify where that information is found in your data. You add the keywords just by entering each word you want Data Classification to recognize. The keywords are added to the existing predefined keywords that Data Classification already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

// For example, you may want to see where internal Product Names are mentioned in all of your files to make sure these names are not accessible in locations that are not secure.

// After updating the custom keywords, Data Classification will restart scanning all data sources. After the scan has completed, the new results will appear in the Data Classification Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

// .Steps

// . From the _Classification settings_ tab, select *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.

// //image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]

// . In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Personal identifier*, and then select *Next*.
// +
// The name you enter will appear in the Data Classification UI as the heading for scanned files that match the classifier requirements, and as the name of the filter in the Investigation page. 
// +
// You can also check the box to "Mask detected results in the system" so the full result won't appear in the UI. For example, you may want to do this to hide full credit card numbers or similar personal data (the mask would appear in the UI like this: "pass:[****] pass:[****] pass:[****]" 3434).

// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_type2.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]

// . In the _Select Data Analysis Tool_ page, select *Custom keywords* as the method you want to use to define the classifier, and then select *Next*.
// +
// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_tool_keywords.png[A screenshot showing the selection of Custom keywords as the tool that Data Classification will use to build the pattern.]

// . In the _Create Logic_ page, enter the keywords you want to recognize - each word on a separate line - and select *Validate*.
// +
// The screenshot below shows internal Product Names (different types of owls). The Data Classification search for these items is not case sensitive.

// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_create_logic_keyword.png[A screenshot of entering the keywords for your custom classifier.]

// . Select *Done*. Data Classification starts to rescan your data.

// .Results
// After the scan is complete, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

// // image:screenshot_add_keywords_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of custom keyword results in the Investigation Results pane.]

// As you can see, the name of the classifier is used as the name in the Personal Results panel. In this manner you can activate many different groups of keywords and see the results for each group.

// == Add custom personal data identifiers using a regex

// You can add a personal pattern to identify specific information in your data using a custom regular expression (regex). This allows you to create a new custom regex to identify new personal information elements that don't yet exist in the system. The regex is added to the existing predefined patterns that Data Classification already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

// For example, you may want to see where your internal Product IDs are mentioned in all of your files. If the Product ID has a clear structure, for example, it is a 12-digit number that starts with 201, you can use the custom regex feature to search for it in your files. The regular expression for this example is *\b201\d{9}\b*.

// After adding the regex, Data Classification will restart scanning all data sources. After the scan has completed, the new results will appear in the Data Classification Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

// If you need assistance in building the regular expression, refer to https://regex101.com/[Regular expressions 101^]. Choose *Python* for the Flavor to see the types of results Data Classification will match from the regular expression. The https://pythonium.net/regex[Python Regex Tester page^] is also useful by displaying a graphical representation of your patterns.

// [NOTE]
// Data Classification doesn't support pattern flags when creating a regex. This means you should not use "/".

// .Steps

// . From the _Classification settings_ tab, select *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.

// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]

// . In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Personal identifier*, and then select *Next*.
// +
// The name you enter will appear in the Data Classification UI as the heading for scanned files that match the classifier requirements, and as the name of the filter in the Investigation page. You can also check the box to "Mask detected results in the system" so the full result won't appear in the UI. For example, you may want to do this to hide full credit card numbers or similar personal data.

// //image:screenshot_select_classifier_type.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]

// . In the _Select Data Analysis Tool_ page, select *Custom regular expression* as the method you want to use to define the classifier, and then select *Next*.

// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_tool_regex.png[A screenshot showing the selection of Custom regular expression as the tool that Data Classification will use to build the pattern.]

// . In the _Create Logic_ page, enter the regular expression and any proximity words, and select *Done*.
// +
// .. You can enter any legal regular expression. Select the *Validate* button to have Data Classification verify that the regular expression is valid, and that it is not too broad -- meaning it will return too many results.
// .. Optionally, you can enter some proximity words to help refine the accuracy of the results. These are words that will typically be found within 300 characters of the pattern you are searching for (either before or after the found pattern). Enter each word, or phrase, on a separate line.

// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_create_logic_regex.png[A screenshot of entering the regex and proximity words for your custom classifier.]

// .Results

// The classifier is added and Data Classification starts to rescan all your data sources. You are returned to the Custom Classifiers page where you can view the number of files that have matched your new classifier. Results from scanning all of your data sources will take some time depending on the number of files that need to be scanned.

// // image:screenshot_personal_info_regex_added.png[A screenshot showing the results of a new regex classifier being added to the system with scanning in progress.]

// == Add custom categories

// Data Classification takes the data that it scans and divides it into different types of categories. Categories are topics based on artificial intelligence analysis of the content and metadata of each file. link:reference-private-data-categories.html#types-of-categories[See the list of predefined categories].

// Categories can help you understand what's happening with your data by showing you the types of information that you have. For example, a category like _resumes_ or _employee contracts_ may include sensitive data. When you investigate the results, you might find that employee contracts are stored in an insecure location. You can then correct that issue.

// You can add custom categories to Data Classification so you can identify where categories of information that are unique for your data estate are found in your data. You add each category by creating "training" files that contain the categories of data that you want to identify, and then have Data Classification scan those files to "learn" through AI so that it can identify that data in your data sources. The categories are added to the existing predefined categories that Data Classification already identifies, and the results are visible under the Categories section. 

// For example, you may want to see where compressed installation files in .gz format are located in your files so that you can remove them, if necessary.

// After updating the custom categories, Data Classification will restart scanning all data sources. After the scan has completed, the new results will appear in the Data Classification Compliance Dashboard under the "Categories" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Category" filter. link:task-controlling-private-data.html#view-files-by-categories[See how to view files by categories].

// .Before you begin

// You'll need to create a minimum of 25 training files that contain samples of the categories of data that you want Data Classification to recognize. The following file types are supported:

// `+.CSV, .DOC, .DOCX, .GZ, .JSON, .PDF, .PPTX, .RTF, .TXT, .XLS, .XLSX, Docs, Sheets, and Slides+`

// The files must be a minimum of 100 bytes, and they must be located in a folder that is accessible by Data Classification.

// .Steps

// . From the _Classification settings_ tab, select *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.

// // image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]

// . In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Category*, and then select *Next*.
// +
// The name you enter will appear in the Data Classification UI as the heading for scanned files that match the category of data you are defining, and as the name of the filter in the Investigation page.

// // image:screenshot_select_classifier_category.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]

// . In the _Create Logic_ page, make sure you have the learning files prepared, and then select *Select files*.

// // image:screenshot_category_create_logic.png[A screenshot of the Create Logic page where you add the files that contain data that you want Data Classification to learn from.]

// . Enter the IP address of the volume, and the path where the training files are located, and select *Add*.

// // image:screenshot_category_add_files.png[A screenshot showing how to enter the location of the training files.]

// . Verify that the training files were recognized by Data Classification. Select the *x* to remove any training files that do not meet the requirements. Then select *Done*.

// // image:screenshot_category_files_added.png[A screenshot showing the files that Data Classification will use as training files that define the new category.]

// .Results

// The new category is created as defined by the training files and added to Data Classification. Then Data Classification starts to rescan all your data sources to identify files that fit into this new category. You are returned to the Custom Classifiers page where you can view the number of files that have matched your new category. Results from scanning all of your data sources will take some time depending on the number of files that need to be scanned.

// == View results from your custom classifiers

// You can view the results from any of your custom classifiers in the Compliance Dashboard and in the Investigation page. For example, this screenshot shows the matched information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section.

// // image:screenshot_add_regex_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of custom regex results in the Investigation Results pane.]

// Select the image:button_arrow_investigate.png[circle with an arrow] button to see the detailed results in the Investigation page.

// Additionally, all of your custom classifier results appear in the Custom Classifiers tab, and the top 6 custom classifier results are displayed in the Compliance Dashboard, as shown below.

// // image:screenshot_custom_classifier_top_5.png[A screenshot showing the top 3 custom classifiers based on returned results.]

// == Manage custom classifiers

// You can change any of the custom classifiers that you have created by using the *Edit Classifier* button.

// TIP: You can't edit Data Fusion classifiers at this time.

// And if you decide at some later point that you don't need Data Classification to identify the custom patterns that you added, you can use the *Delete Classifier* button to remove each item.

// // image:screenshot_custom_classifiers_manage.png[A screenshot of the Custom Classifiers page with the buttons to edit and delete a classifier.]
