Complete a few steps to start scanning data within object storage directly with NetApp Data Classification. Data Classification can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, Linode, B2 Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and more.

[IMPORTANT]
The following information is relevant only for Data Classification legacy versions 1.30 and earlier. +
Beginning with version 1.31, Data Classification is part of the core NetApp Console offering. For more information, see link:task-scanning-storagegrid.html[Scan StorageGRID data]. 

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from the object storage provider so that Data Classification can access the buckets.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add the object storage service to Data Classification.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the buckets that you'd like to scan and Data Classification will start scanning them.

== Reviewing object storage requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Data Classification.

* You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

* You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from the object storage provider so that Data Classification can access the buckets.
//
//* Support for Azure Blob requires that you use the link:https://min.io/[MinIO service^].

== Deploying the Data Classification instance

Deploy Data Classification if there isn't already an instance deployed.

If you are scanning data from S3 object storage that is accessible over the internet, you can link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deploy Data Classification in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[deploy Data Classification in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

If you are scanning data from S3 object storage that has been installed in a dark site that has no internet access, you need to link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deploy Data Classification in the same on-premises location that has no internet access^]. This also requires that the Console agent is deployed in that same on-premises location.

Upgrades to Data Classification software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

== Adding the object storage service to Data Classification

Add the object storage service.

.Steps

. From the Systems Configuration page, select *Add Data Source* > *Add Object Storage Service*.
+
// image:screenshot_compliance_add_object_storage_button.png[A screenshot of the Scan Configuration page where you can select the Add File Shares Group button.]

. In the Add Object Storage Service dialog, enter the details for the object storage service and select *Continue*.
.. Enter the name you want to use for the System. This name should reflect the name of the object storage service to which you are connecting.
.. Enter the Endpoint URL to access the object storage service.
.. Enter the Access Key and Secret Key so that Data Classification can access the buckets in the object storage.
+
// image:screenshot_compliance_add_object_storage.png[A screenshot of the dialog where you enter the values to access the object storage service.]

.Result

The new Object Storage Service is added to the list of systems.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on object storage buckets

After you enable Data Classification on your Object Storage Service, the next step is to configure the buckets that you want to scan. Data Classification discovers those buckets and displays them in the system you created.

.Steps

. In the Configuration page, select *Configuration* from the Object Storage Service system.
+
// image:screenshot_compliance_object_storage_config.png[A screenshot of clicking Configuration for the system so you can choose the buckets that you want to scan.]

. Enable mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, on your buckets.

|===
| To:
| Do this:

| Enable mapping-only scans on a bucket | Select *Map*
| Enable full scans on a bucket | Select *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on a bucket | Select *Off*

|===

.Result

Data Classification starts scanning the buckets that you enabled. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.
