NetaApp Data Classification supports saving your search queries. With a saved query, you can create custom filters to sort through frequent queries of your data Investigation page. Data Classification also includes predefined saved queries based on common requests. 

The *Saved queries* tab in the Compliance dashboard lists all the predefined and custom saved queries available on this instance of Data Classification.

Saved queries also appear in the list of filters in the Investigation page.
