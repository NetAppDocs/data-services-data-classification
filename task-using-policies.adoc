NetaApp Data Classification supports saving your search queries. With a saved query, you can create custom filters to sort through frequent queries of your data Investigation page. Data Classification also includes predefined saved queries based on common requests. 

The *Saved queries* tab in the Compliance dashboard lists all the predefined and custom saved queries available on this instance of Data Classification.

Saved queries can also be saved as **policies**. Whereas queries filter data, policies allow you to act on the data. With a policy: you can delete discovered data or send email updates about the discovered data. 

Saved queries also appear in the list of filters in the Investigation page.
