NetaApp Data Classification supports saving your search queries. With a saved search, you can create custom filters to sort through frequent queries of your data Investigation page. Data Classification also includes predefined saved searches based on common requests. 

The *Saved searches* tab in the Compliance dashboard lists all the predefined and custom saved searches available on this instance of Data Classification.

Saved searches also appear in the list of filters in the Investigation page.
