There are many types of private data that NetApp Data Classification can identify in your volumes and databases. 

Data Classification identifies two types of personal data: 

* *Personally identifiable information (PII)*
* *Sensitive personal information (SPII)*

TIP: If you need Data Classification to identify other private data types, such as additional national ID numbers or healthcare identifiers, contact your account manager. 

== Types of personal data

The personal data, or _personally identifiable information_ (PII), found in files can be general personal data or national identifiers. The third column in the table below identifies whether Data Classification uses link:task-controlling-private-data.html#view-files-that-contain-personal-data[proximity validation^] to validate its findings for the identifier.

The languages in which these items can be recognized are identified in the table.

//Note that you can add to the list of personal data that is found in your files. If you are scanning a database server, the _Data Fusion_ feature enables you to choose additional identifiers that Data Classification will look for in its scans by selecting columns in a database table. You can also add custom keywords from a text file, or custom patterns using a regular expression. See link:task-managing-data-fusion.html[Adding personal data identifiers to your Data Classification scans^] for details.

== Types of files

Data Classification scans all files for category and metadata insights and displays all file types in the file types section of the dashboard. When Data Classification detects Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or when it performs a DSAR search, only the following file formats are supported:

`+.CSV, .DCM, .DOC, .DOCX, .JSON, .PDF, .PPTX, .RTF, .TXT, .XLS, .XLSX, Docs, Sheets, and Slides+`

== Accuracy of information found

NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Data Classification identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

Based on our testing, the table below shows the accuracy of the information that Data Classification finds. We break it down by _precision_ and _recall_:

Precision:: The probability that what Data Classification finds has been identified correctly. For example, a precision rate of 90% for personal data means that 9 out of 10 files identified as containing personal information, actually contain personal information. 1 out of 10 files would be a false positive.

Recall:: The probability for Data Classification to find what it should. For example, a recall rate of 70% for personal data means that Data Classification can identify 7 out of 10 files that actually contain personal information in your organization. Data Classification would miss 30% of the data and it won't appear in the dashboard.

We are constantly improving the accuracy of our results. Those improvements will be automatically available in future Data Classification releases.
